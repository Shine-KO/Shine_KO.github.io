        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <section><p>Hello, my name is David Valdivia. I come from a spanish speaking family but I came out of my family only being able to speak English. I do understand Spanish and speak it but I am far from comfortable holding a conversation in Spanish. When I was very young my mom specifically had me swimming competitively as soon as I was able to. I swam from about 6 years old up until University level. I swam for UCSD, which was the university I was admitted into for Mechanical Engineering. However, I did stop swimming competitvely and also switched my majors to computer science and in order to save some money I came back to the community college I live close to.
